Working but not ready for use. In order, it needs:

- ~~Decal system~~;
- ~~Better menu HTML handling~~;
- Fix some known bugs;
- Duplicator enhancements (loading bar);
- Check if animated decals are possible through decals;
- Multiplayer testing;
- General bug hunting;
- Preview system (Completely clientside this time!!);
- (Auto) Save/Load system;
- Multiplayer specific functions;
- More testing and bug hunting;
- Full code comentaries review;
- Propaganda;
- Release.

W.I.P.

Hopefully, it will be worth the weight.
