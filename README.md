# MAP RETEXTURIZER

Good stuff for Garry's Mod!

If you are willing to use this tool directly from Github, just download the contents and place them inside GMod addons folder. Also, don't forget to run the .bat file inside materials/mapretexturizer, it'll create all the necessary .vmt files automatically.
